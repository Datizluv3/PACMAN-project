<h1 align='center'> Project 1. Search - Let’s chase Pac-Man!</h1>

## Problem Description
Pac-Man is a classic arcade game where the player controls Pac-Man character to navigate a maze,
collecting dots while avoiding ghosts. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible and
maximizing the number of collected food points. The ghosts are programmed to chase Pac-Man,
creating a challenging and engaging experience.
In this project, students will program the ghosts to chase Pac-Man using search algorithms.
The objective is to implement different path finding strategies and then analyze their effectiveness.
Each ghost is programmed with a search algorithm, including: **(1) BFS (Breadth-First Search),(2) DFS (Depth-First Search), (3) UCS (Uniform-Cost Search), and (4) A* (A-Star Search);**
then evaluated based on performance metrics such as (1) search time, (2) memory usage, and
(3) number of expanded nodes
